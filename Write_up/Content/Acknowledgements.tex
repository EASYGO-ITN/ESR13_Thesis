Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors: Paola Bombarda for her support and guidance throughout the past three years of this journey; Martin O. Saar for hosting me in the GEG group at ETH Zurich during my year long secondment; Claudio Pietra, Joseph Bonafin for welcoming me in the Turboden offices in Brescia for three months; Allan Leal for stimulating chats about chemical equilibria and thermophysical properties; Dario Alfani for his mentorship; and finally, Paolo Silva. 

I would also like to thank Turboden S.p.A for hosting me in their offices in Brescia for three months; Mario Gaia, for his continued interest in my work; Maren Brehme without whom Easygo would not have been possible, and Paromita Deb for organising the training weeks and keeping us Easygoers in check.

Many thanks also to Lorenzo Galieti whose codebase \emph{wopycle} served as inspiration for the creation of \emph{PowerCycle}, and his co-laboration in our joint submission to the EGW 2023. 

A special thanks goes to my family and friends: first and foremost my wife, Alexandra, for going out on a limb and following me to Zurich, Brescia and Milan, for her endurance, patience and support throughout the past three years, particularly the final thesis write-up and the numerous conference attendances abroad; my parents and siblings for encouraging me to embark on this adventure in Italy and Switzerland, my parents in-law for welcoming me on their farm for many well-needed respites; my fellow Easygoers Andrea, Anna, Hagen, Lorenzo and Nicolas for much needed fun outside of the office, be it swimming in the Limmat, BBQs, fondue nights or Apericena.
