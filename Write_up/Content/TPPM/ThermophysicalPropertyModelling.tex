The geofluid's phase behaviour and its thermophysical properties are fundamental inputs to the design of any geothermal power plant. These properties are expensive to obtain experimentally. In the absence of holistic or predictive models to handle the broad range of geofluid compositions we must often rely on mathematical models, equations of state and calibrating model parameters based on what little field data is available.

This chapter aims to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art modelling approaches for predicting the thermophysical properties of fluids in general and more specifically geofluids. We then present a calculation framework that combines these modelling approaches, and illustrate its use in a number of case studies. Finally, we present a unified calculation framework that combines a number of properties estimation frameworks, which can be used for simulating power plants and other physical processes.
